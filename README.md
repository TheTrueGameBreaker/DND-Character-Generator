# Random DnD Character Generator

## Description

User Story: I as a Dungeons and Dragons player want to randomize a character so that I may have inspiration to build a new character.

When I click generate I am presented with a random class, race, alignment, companion, and randomized stat numbers.
When I click save I am able to save the character displayed on the page.
When I click view saved I am taken to a page and can view my most recently saved character.


We built this project to help dnd players make characters, whether it’s due to having writers block, needing a new character on the fly due to a last second one shot, or simply cause they want to try something new.
On this project we learned how to collaborate as a team and became familiar with new things such as Tailwind.
